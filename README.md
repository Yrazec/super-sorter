# Super Sorter

## General

Windows Forms App (.NET Framework 4.7.2) for some sorting algorithms like Bogo Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort or Quick Sort.

## Additional information

- Remember to first select *Separator* and *Data Type* in the *Data* area before clicking the *Load Data* button.

- You can generate random data in *Application* tab (separator: new line, data type: integers).

- Be careful with Bogo Sort! It's incredibly complex!

- Probably Quick Sort needs to be fixed! It returns slightly different data than other algorithms (after sorting).

- The application and algorithms are imperfect - if you find an bug, please contact me! Report an bug by sending: loaded data, selected separator, selected data type, selected sorting algorithms and stacktrace.
